## readFiles Function Documentation

This Dart function reads all files within a given directory path and returns a map containing the file paths as keys and their contents as values.

**Signature:**

```dart
Future<Map<String, String>> readFiles(String paths) async
```

**Parameters:**

* **paths (String):** The path to the directory containing the files to read.

**Returns:**

* **Future<Map<String, String>>:** A future that resolves to a map containing the file paths as keys and their contents as values.

**Example Usage:**

```dart
void main() async {
  final files = await readFiles('/path/to/directory');
  print(files); // Print the map of file paths and contents
}
```

**Functionality Breakdown:**

1. **Input Validation:** The function first checks if the provided path is a valid directory. If not, it prints an error message and exits the program.
2. **File Listing:** The function uses `Directory.list()` to recursively list all files and directories within the specified path.
3. **Asynchronous File Reading:** The function utilizes a `Completer` to handle the asynchronous nature of file reading. It listens to the `lister` stream and adds each file to a list. If an error occurs during file listing, the `completer` is completed with an error, and the program exits.
4. **Filtering and Reading:** Once all files have been listed, the function filters the list to include only files (excluding directories) using `whereType<File>()`. It then iterates through the file list and reads the contents of each file using `file.readAsString()`.
5. **Returning Results:** The function returns a map containing the file paths as keys and their contents as values.

**Error Handling:**

* The function handles potential errors during file listing by using a `Completer` and an `onError` callback.
* If an error occurs, the program prints an error message and exits.

**Best Practices:**

* The function utilizes async/await for efficient asynchronous operations.
* The use of a `Completer` allows for a cleaner and more readable way to handle asynchronous file reading.
* The function includes error handling to prevent program crashes in case of unexpected errors.
* The function follows the Dart style guide for code formatting and documentation.
